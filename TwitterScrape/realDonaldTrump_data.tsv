"@trumplican2016: .@realDonaldTrump  There will be MASSIVE turnout for you   Mr. Trump - These polls don't register the pulse of the PEOPLE!	10323

Wow  just saw the really bad @CNN ratings. People don't want to watch bad product that only builds up Crooked Hillary.	10971
The so-called Commission on Presidential Debates admitted to us that the DJT audio &amp; sound level was very bad. So why didn't they fix it?	10536

Remember  don't believe "sources said" by the VERY dishonest media. If they don't name the sources  the sources don't exist.	17162
Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?	17936
Using Alicia M in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that Crooked Hillary suffers from BAD JUDGEMENT! Hillary was set up by a con.	11572
Wow  Crooked Hillary was duped and used by my worst Miss U. Hillary floated her as an "angel" without checking her past  which is terrible!	11130
